        "Made by Isabel Taylor

    Extras added:
        1. Home screen activity!
        2. Changeable board size!
        3. Warning when too many flags are placed (by changing visibility!)
        4. User cannot win game when too many flags are placed
        5. User can undo flag placement! And can overwrite flag placement by clicking in try mode!
        6. User is blocked from changing the board once game is won or lost!
        7. However, if they press reset then they can play a new game, with new mines!
        8. Mines are randomly generated!
        9. SHIMMER TEXT

    Known Bugs:
        1. The mines and numbers donâ€™t update with the user size (Though the logic is the same)
        2. Each square has a 20% chance of becoming a mine, so the number will fluctuate from game to game"</string>
